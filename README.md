This project is made to scrape a bunch of resumes appended together in a single pdf .
The source code can be easily modified to read a single file at a time or a bunch of different pdf's.

The program will read the pdf and write the data in a csv format to obtain usefull information 
such as User-Email, Mobile Number, Name of the candidate.

Most probably be usefull to the HR guys to go through a bunch of pdf's to extract contact details.
